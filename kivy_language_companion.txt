Because the kivy language for the client is contained within a string, I can't put comments onto it. This file will provide documentation for the kivy language within the program.

TitleScreen
This is the title screen for the client. From here the user chooses between 'anonymous functions' and 'authorized functions'.

###Anonymous Functions###
This is a group for functions that don't require an imgur login authentication to use. Currently the only one is a gallery getter, which pulls links from the imgur gallery.

AnonFunctions_1
This is the first screen, for choosing which function to use.

AnonFunctions_Gallery1
This screen is where the user chooses the section option for the gallery function. The choices are between hot, top, and 'user' which means user-submitted.

AnonFunctions_Gallery2
This screen is where the user chooses the sort option. 'viral' for their viral sorting, and 'time' for most recent within the selected section.

AnonFunctions_Gallery3
This screen contains the TextInput that the links are put into. It needs to be a TextInput so that the user can select the text and copy the link.

Auth_1
This is where the user will authenticate their imgur account with the client. They press a button that opens a browser window where they log in and get a pin. The pin is pasted into the TextInput, and then they press the other button to validate and move on to the next screen.

AuthFunctions_1
Where the users choose which function to use

AuthFunctions_GetUser_1
Originally this was going to be split into three screens but there were too many issues with the variables.
In this function, the user can input an Imgur username and get some info about their account.
